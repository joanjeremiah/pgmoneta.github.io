    <h2>Installating pgmoneta</h2>

    This tutorial will show you how to do a simple installation of pgmoneta.
    <p/>

    At the end of this tutorial you will have a backup of a PostgreSQL cluster,
    and will be streaming Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to pgmoneta.
    <p>

    <h3>Preface</h3>

    This tutorial assumes that you have an installation of PostgreSQL 10+ and pgmoneta.
    <p/>

    For RPM based distributions such as Fedora and RHEL you can add the
    <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL YUM repository</a>
    and do the install via
    
    <pre>
dnf install -y postgresql10 postgresql10-server pgmoneta
    </pre>

    <h3>Initialize cluster</h3>

    <pre>
export PATH=/usr/pgsql-10/bin:$PATH
initdb /tmp/pgsql
    </pre>

    <p>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Remove default access</h3>
    
    Remove

    <pre>
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust
    </pre>

    from /tmp/pgsql/pg_hba.conf.

    <p>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Add access for users and a database</h3>

    Add

    <pre>
host    mydb             myuser          127.0.0.1/32            md5
host    mydb             myuser          ::1/128                 md5
host    postgres         repl            127.0.0.1/32            md5
host    postgres         repl            ::1/128                 md5
host    replication      repl            127.0.0.1/32            md5
host    replication      repl            ::1/128                 md5
    </pre>

    to /tmp/pgsql/pg_hba.conf. Or use scram-sha-256.

    <p>

    Remember to check the value of password_encryption in /tmp/pgsql/postgresql.conf
    to setup the correct authentication type.

    <p>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Make sure that replication level is set</h3>

    Check that

    <pre>
wal_level = replica
    </pre>

    is set in /tmp/pgsql/postgresql.conf - or logical

    <p>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Start PostgreSQL</h3>


    <pre>
pg_ctl  -D /tmp/pgsql/ start
    </pre>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Add users and a database</h3>

    <pre>
createuser -P myuser
createdb -E UTF8 -O myuser mydb
    </pre>

    with mypass as the password.

    <p>

    Then

    <pre>
psql postgres
CREATE ROLE repl WITH LOGIN REPLICATION PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
\q
    </pre>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Verify access</h3>

    For the user (standard) (using mypass)

    <pre>
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U myuser mydb
\q
    </pre>

    For the user (pgmoneta) (using secretpassword)

    <pre>
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U repl postgres
\q
    </pre>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Add pgmoneta user</h3>

    <pre>
sudo su -
useradd -ms /bin/bash pgmoneta
passwd pgmoneta
exit
    </pre>

    as postgres user

    <h3>Create pgmoneta configuration</h3>

    Switch to the pgmoneta user

    <pre>
sudo su -
su - pgmoneta
    </pre>

    Add the master key and create vault

    <pre>
pgmoneta-admin master-key
pgmoneta-admin -f pgmoneta_users.conf -U repl -P secretpassword add-user
    </pre>

    You have to choose a password for the master key - remember it !

    <p>

      Create the pgmoneta.conf configuration

      <pre>
cat > pgmoneta.conf
[pgmoneta]
host = *
metrics = 5001

base_dir = /home/pgmoneta/backup

compression = zstd

storage_engine = local

retention = 7

log_type = file
log_level = info
log_path = /tmp/pgmoneta.log

unix_socket_dir = /tmp/
pgsql_dir = /usr/pgsql-10/bin/

[primary]
host = localhost
port = 5432
user = repl
      </pre>

      and press Ctrl-D

      <p>

      as postgres user

      <h3>Create base directory</h3>

      <pre>
mkdir backup
      </pre>

      as pgmoneta user

      <h3>Start pgmoneta</h3>

      <pre>
pgmoneta -c pgmoneta.conf -u pgmoneta_users.conf
      </pre>

      as pgmoneta user

      <h3>Create a backup</h3>

      In another terminal

      <pre>
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf backup primary
      </pre>

      as pgmoneta user

      <h3>View backup</h3>

      In another terminal

      <pre>
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf details
      </pre>

      as pgmoneta user

      <h3>Shell completion</h3>

      There is a minimal shell completion support for pgmoneta-cli and pgmoneta-admin. If you are running such commands
      from a Bash or Zsh, you can take some advantage of command completion.

      <h4>Installing command completions in Bash</h4>

      There is a completion script into contrib/shell_comp/pgmoneta_comp.bash that can be used
      to help you complete the command line while you are typing.

      <p>

        It is required to source the script into your current shell, for instance
        by doing:

        <pre>
source contrib/shell_comp/pgmoneta_comp.bash
        </pre>

        At this point, the completions should be active, so you can type the name of one the commands between
        pgmoneta-cli and pgmoneta-admin and hit TAB to help the command line completion.

        <h4>Installing the command completions on Zsh</h4>

        In order to enable completion into zsh you first need to have compinit loaded;
        ensure your .zshrc file contains the following lines:

        <pre>
autoload -U compinit
compinit
        </pre>

        and add the sourcing of the contrib/shell_comp/pgmoneta_comp.zsh file into your ~/.zshrc
        also associating the _pgmoneta_cli and _pgmoneta_admin functions
        to completion by means of compdef:

        <pre>
source contrib/shell_comp/pgmoneta_comp.zsh
compdef _pgmoneta_cli    pgmoneta-cli
compdef _pgmoneta_admin  pgmoneta-admin
        </pre>

        If you want completions only for one command, e.g., pgmoneta-admin, remove the compdef line that references
        the command you don't want to have automatic completion. At this point, digit the name of a pgmoneta-cli
        or pgmoneta-admin command and hit TAB to trigger the completion system.
