    <h2>Getting started with pgmoneta</h2>

    First of all, make sure that pgmoneta is installed and in your path by
    using "pgmoneta -?". You should see

    <pre>
pgmoneta 0.5.7
  Backup / restore solution for PostgreSQL

Usage:
  pgmoneta [ -c CONFIG_FILE ] [ -u USERS_FILE ] [ -d ]

Options:
  -c, --config CONFIG_FILE Set the path to the pgmoneta.conf file
  -u, --users USERS_FILE   Set the path to the pgmoneta_users.conf file
  -A, --admins ADMINS_FILE Set the path to the pgmoneta_admins.conf file
  -d, --daemon             Run as a daemon
  -V, --version            Display version information
  -?, --help               Display help
    </pre>

    If you don't have pgmoneta in your path see our <a href="https://github.com/pgmoneta/pgmoneta/blob/main/README.md">README</a>
    on how to compile and install pgmoneta in your system.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>

    Lets create a simple configuration file called <b>pgmoneta.conf</b> with the content

    <pre>
[pgmoneta]
host = *
metrics = 5001

base_dir = /home/pgmoneta

compression = zstd

retention = 7

log_type = file
log_level = info
log_path = /tmp/pgmoneta.log

unix_socket_dir = /tmp/
pgsql_dir = /usr/bin/

[primary]
host = localhost
port = 5432
user = repl
    </pre>

    In our main section called <b>[pgmoneta]</b> we setup pgmoneta to listen on all
    network addresses. We will enable Prometheus metrics on port 5001 and have the backups
    live in the "/home/pgmoneta" directory. All backups are being compressed with zstd and kept
    for 7 days. Logging will be performed at "info" level and
    put in a file called "/tmp/pgmoneta.log". Last we specify the
    location of the "unix_socket_dir" used for management operations and the path for the
    PostgreSQL command line tools.
    <p/>
    Next we create a section called <b>[primary]</b> which has the information about our
    <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> instance. In this case it is running
    on "localhost" on port "5432" and we will use the "repl" user account to connect.
    <p/>
    The "repl" user must have the "REPLICATION" role and have access to the "postgres" database,
    so for example
    <pre>
CREATE ROLE repl WITH LOGIN REPLICATION PASSWORD 'secretpassword';
    </pre>

    and in pg_hba.conf

    <pre>
local   postgres        repl                                   scram-sha-256
host    postgres        repl           127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    postgres        repl           ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    replication     repl           127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    replication     repl           ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
    </pre>

    Optionally, create a physical replication slot that can be used for Write-Ahead Log streaming,
    like

    <pre>
SELECT pg_create_physical_replication_slot('repl');
    </pre>

    and add that to the pgmoneta.conf configuration under [primary], as

    <pre>
wal_slot = repl
    </pre>

    <p/>
    We will need a user vault for the "repl" account, so the following commands will add
    a master key, and the "repl" password
    <pre>
pgmoneta-admin master-key
pgmoneta-admin -f pgmoneta_users.conf add-user
    </pre>
    <p/>
    We are now ready to run pgmoneta.

    See <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a> for all configuration options.

    <h3>Running</h3>

    We will run pgmoneta using the command

    <pre>
pgmoneta -c pgmoneta.conf -u pgmoneta_users.conf
    </pre>

    If this doesn't give an error, then we are ready to do backups.
    <p/>

    pgmoneta is stopped by pressing Ctrl-C (^C) in the console where you started it, or by sending
    the SIGTERM signal to the process using "kill pid".

    <h3>Run-time administration</h3>

    pgmoneta has a run-time administration tool called pgmoneta-cli.
    <p/>
    You can see the commands it supports by using "pgmoneta-cli -?" which will give

    <pre>
pgmoneta-cli 0.5.7
  Command line utility for pgmoneta

Usage:
  pgmoneta-cli [ -c CONFIG_FILE ] [ COMMAND ]

Options:
  -c, --config CONFIG_FILE Set the path to the pgmoneta.conf file
  -h, --host HOST          Set the host name
  -p, --port PORT          Set the port number
  -U, --user USERNAME      Set the user name
  -P, --password PASSWORD  Set the password
  -L, --logfile FILE       Set the log file
  -v, --verbose            Output text string of the result
  -V, --version            Display version information
  -?, --help               Display help

Commands:
  backup                   Backup a server
  list-backup              List the backups for a server
  restore                  Restore a backup from a server
  archive                  Archive a backup from a server
  delete                   Delete a backup from a server
  retain                   Retain a backup from a server
  expunge                  Expunge a backup from a server
  is-alive                 Is pgmoneta alive
  stop                     Stop pgmoneta
  status                   Status of pgmoneta
  details                  Detailed status of pgmoneta
  reload                   Reload the configuration
  reset                    Reset the Prometheus statistics
    </pre>

    This tool can be used on the machine running pgmoneta to do a backup like

    <pre>
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf backup primary
    </pre>

    A restore would be

    <pre>
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf restore primary <timestamp> /path/to/restore
    </pre>

    To stop pgmoneta you would use

    <pre>
pgmoneta-cli -c pgmoneta.conf stop
    </pre>

    Check the outcome of the operations by verifying the exit code, like

    <pre>
echo $?
    </pre>

    or by using the -v flag.

    <p/>
    If pgmoneta has both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and "management" enabled then pgmoneta-cli can
    connect with TLS using the files ~/.pgmoneta/pgmoneta.key (must be 0600 permission),
    ~/.pgmoneta/pgmoneta.crt and ~/.pgmoneta/root.crt.

    <h3>Administration</h3>

    pgmoneta has an administration tool called pgmoneta-admin, which is used to control user
    registration with pgmoneta.
    <p/>
    You can see the commands it supports by using "pgmoneta-admin -?" which will give

    <pre>
pgmoneta-admin 0.5.7
  Administration utility for pgmoneta

Usage:
  pgmoneta-admin [ -f FILE ] [ COMMAND ]

Options:
  -f, --file FILE         Set the path to a user file
  -U, --user USER         Set the user name
  -P, --password PASSWORD Set the password for the user
  -g, --generate          Generate a password
  -l, --length            Password length
  -V, --version           Display version information
  -?, --help              Display help

Commands:
  master-key              Create or update the master key
  add-user                Add a user
  update-user             Update a user
  remove-user             Remove a user
  list-users              List all users
    </pre>

    In order to set the master key for all users you can use

    <pre>
pgmoneta-admin -g master-key
    </pre>

    The master key must be at least 8 characters.
    <p/>

    Then use the other commands to add, update, remove or list the current user names, f.ex.

    <pre>
pgmoneta-admin -f pgmoneta_users.conf add-user
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    Next steps in improving pgmoneta's configuration could be

    <ul>
      <li>Update pgmoneta.conf with the required settings for your system</li>
      <li>Enable Transport Layer Security v1.2+ (TLS)</li>
    </ul>

    See <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a> for more information on these subjects.
